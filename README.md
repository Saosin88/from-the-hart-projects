## 🔍 Overview

The From The Hart Projects API provides endpoints for managing and displaying projects across the From The Hart ecosystem. Key capabilities include:

- Project data management with structured schemas
- Support for both traditional server and serverless deployments
- Swagger documentation for API exploration
- Type-safe API implementation with TypeBox
- Part of the broader From The Hart multi-cloud architecture

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Fastify with TypeScript
- **Type Safety**: TypeBox (@fastify/type-provider-typebox)
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployments
- **Serverless**: AWS Lambda container support
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform (managed in the `from-the-hart-infrastructure` repository)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- AWS CLI (for Lambda deployment)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saosin88/from-the-hart-projects.git
cd from-the-hart-projects
npm install
```

### Local Development

To start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server with hot-reload enabled, allowing you to make changes without restarting the server.

### Docker Configuration

#### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image with specific environment settings:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NODE_ENV=local --build-arg LOG_LEVEL=debug -t from-the-hart-projects .
```

#### Running the Docker Container

To run the container in detached mode and map it to port 8080:

```bash
docker run --name from_the_hart_projects -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 from-the-hart-projects
```

#### Viewing Logs

To follow the container logs:

```bash
docker logs -f from_the_hart_projects
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

The project uses Jest for unit tests and includes coverage reporting.

## 🌐 Infrastructure

This service is part of the "From The Hart" multi-cloud architecture managed with Terraform. The infrastructure is defined in the separate `from-the-hart-infrastructure` repository using the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach.

### Cloud Provider Details

- **Primary Platform**: AWS Lambda
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for Terraform state
- **Container Registry**: AWS ECR for Lambda container images
- **Access Control**: AWS IAM with least-privilege policy
- **API Gateway Integration**: Through Cloudflare Workers reverse proxy

The infrastructure is managed using Terraform with modules for reusability:
- State is stored remotely in an S3 bucket (`from-the-hart-terraform`)
- Cloudflare Workers provide API reverse proxying and routing

For infrastructure deployments, refer to the `terraform/` directory which contains separate configurations for `dev` and `prod` environments.

## 📚 API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the Swagger documentation at:

```
http://localhost:8080/projects/documentation
```

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be set:

- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (dev, prod, local)
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
- `PORT` - Port to run the server on (defaults to 8080)
- `HOST` - Host address to bind the server to (defaults to "0.0.0.0")
